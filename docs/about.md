# E.E. Design | About

## Purpose
This documentation is to assist in the documentation of the electronics and electrical engineering design for the OpenVent.org open-source, open-hardware ventilator.

## Scope
The scope of this documentation is limited to the electronics and electrical engineering only. While there is some cross-over between the software/firmware developers, mechanical engineers, and medical advisors, only the essential information for the MVP will be included.
